					With more than 213,000 alumni spread around the world, we strive to help everyone, maintain a connection to the university-and we need your help! We want to ensure that your alumni experience is as amazing as your student experience, but we can't do it without you. When you volunteer you'll meet dozens of Huskies who live and work nearby, most of whom share a tremendous affinity for Northeastern. 

					Volunteering is not a huge commitment, and can include everything from sending potential event ideas or helping to secure locations for future events in the city.
